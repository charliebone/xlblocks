# Lists

Lists are ordered collections of items that can store values of any type, including other XlBlocks objects. They provide functionality for adding, removing, and accessing elements by their position. They can be merged with other lists, sorted, and filtered for unique or duplicate values. Lists are represented in Excel using object handles, enabling seamless integration with other XlBlocks objects.
